4. RDP UserMode 
  - Remote Registry
            Enables remote users to modify registry settings on your computer, provided the remote 
            users have the required permissions
  - RD Configuration:

            as a way of automatically forwarding only needed ports. It means one would not have to muck about 
            with portforwarding, but alas it never does work out quite that way. :-)
  - Remote Desktop:
            Remote Desktop Connection is a technology that allows you to sit at a computer (sometimes

Commonly Hacked Ports
By Kevin Beaver
Part of the Hacking For Dummies Cheat Sheet
Common ports, such as TCP port 80 (HTTP), may be locked down — but other ports may get overlooked and be vulnerable to hackers. In your security tests, be sure to check these commonly hacked TCP and UDP ports:
TCP port 21 - FTP (File Transfer Protocol)
TCP port 22 – SSH (Secure Shell)
TCP port 23 - telnet
TCP port 25 - SMTP (Simple Mail Transfer Protocol)
TCP and UDP port 53 - DNS (Domain Name System)
TCP port 443 - HTTP (Hypertext Transport Protocol) and HTTPS (HTTP over SSL)
TCP port 110 - POP3 (Post Office Protocol version 3)
TCP and UDP port 135 - Windows RPC
TCP and UDP ports 137–139 - Windows NetBIOS over TCP/IP
TCP port 1433 and UDP port 1434 – Microsoft SQL Server
